Problem Statement:
Build an agent to solve a modifed version of the 8 puzzle problem (called the Expense 8 puzzle problem). The task is still to take a 3 by 3 grid on which 8 tiles have been placed, where you can only move one tile at a time to an adjacent location (as long as it is blank) and figure out the order in which to move the tiles to get it to a desired configuration. However now the number on the tile now also represents the cot of moving that tile (moving the tile marked 6 costs 6). Only Write the main method for this program in python.

Your program should be called expense_8_puzzle and the command line invocation should follow the following format:

expense_8_puzzle.py <start-file> <goal-file> <method> <dump-flag>

<start-file> and <goal-file> are required.
 <method> can be
 bfs - Breadth First Search
ucs - Uniform Cost Search
dfs - Depth First Search
dls - Depth Limited Search (Note: Depth Limit will be obtained as a Console Input) [Note: This part is EC for CSE 4308 students]
ids - Iterative Deepening Search [Note: This part is EC for CSE 4308 students]
greedy - Greedy Seach
a* - A* Search (Note: if no <method> is given, this should be the default option)
If <dump-flag>  is given as true, search trace is dumped for analysis in trace-<date>-<time>.txt (Note: if <dump-flag> is not given, assume it is false)
search trace contains: fringe and closed set contents per loop of search(and per iteration for IDS), counts of nodes expanded and nodes

Sample Start File Contents:-
2 3 6
1 0 7
4 8 5
END OF FILE

Sample End File Contents:-
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0
END OF FILE

You do not need to create files. You just need to emulate the process.


Expected Output:-
Nodes Popped: 97
Nodes Expanded: 64
Nodes Generated: 173
Max Fringe Size: 77
Solution Found at depth 12 with cost of 63.
